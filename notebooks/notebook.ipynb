    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn represents a critical and costly problem for telecommunications companies. Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones, making early identification of customers at risk of leaving a high-impact business priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build a decision-support system that helps a telecommunications provider proactively identify customers who are likely to churn so that retention interventions can be deployed before the customer leaves. This project frames churn prediction not as a purely technical classification task, but as a cost-sensitive business problem where different types of errors carry different consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a business perspective, failing to identify a customer who is about to churn (a false negative) results in lost revenue and increased acquisition costs. In contrast, incorrectly flagging a customer who would not have churned (a false positive) typically results in a smaller, more controllable cost, such as an unnecessary retention offer or outreach. As a result, this project prioritizes recall for churned customers over overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended stakeholders for this project are data scientists and business decision-makers within a telecommunications organization. Data scientists can use this notebook as a reproducible framework for training and evaluating churn models, while business stakeholders can use the model outputs to guide retention strategies and allocate intervention resources more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the objective is not to build a model that is “right most of the time,” but to build a system that minimizes missed churn cases and supports proactive, data-driven decision-making aimed at stopping churn at all cost.\n"

    "This project uses two publicly available telecommunications customer churn datasets to improve model robustness and generalizability. Both datasets describe customer-level behavior and service characteristics in a telecommunications context, with a binary churn indicator as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multiple datasets allows the model to learn churn patterns across different customer populations rather than overfitting to a single source. This approach also reflects a real-world scenario where organizations often combine historical data from multiple systems or time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset 1: IBM Telco Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary dataset used in this project is the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset. Each row represents a single customer, with features describing account tenure, billing information, subscribed services, and contract details. The dataset contains several thousand customer records, making it suitable for training supervised machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable, **Churn**, indicates whether a customer discontinued service. This dataset provides rich behavioral and contractual information that is directly relevant to churn prediction in a telecommunications setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset 2: BigML Telecommunications Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is a telecommunications churn dataset provided by BigML. This dataset also contains customer-level records with a binary churn indicator. Features focus primarily on customer usage patterns, such as call minutes, call counts, international plan usage, and customer service interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While smaller than the IBM dataset, the BigML dataset provides complementary usage-focused features that align with churn-related customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rationale for Combining Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets represent the same underlying business problem: predicting customer churn in a telecommunications environment. Although the datasets originate from different sources and contain different feature sets, they share overlapping conceptual information related to customer behavior, service usage, and churn outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than treating the datasets as interchangeable, this project aligns shared feature concepts across datasets and combines them into a unified modeling dataset. This feature-aligned approach allows the model to learn from a larger and more diverse customer population while maintaining semantic consistency across features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the datasets in this way supports the business objective of building a churn detection system that generalizes beyond a single dataset and improves the model’s ability to identify churned customers across varying customer profiles.\n"

    "# Feature Alignment Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Before combining datasets, it is necessary to define a feature alignment strategy to ensure that the merged data is semantically consistent and meaningful for modeling. Because the IBM Telco and BigML datasets originate from different sources, they do not share identical column names or feature definitions. Blindly concatenating the datasets would introduce noise and undermine interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project adopts a **feature-aligned union** approach. Rather than merging all raw columns, only shared conceptual features related to customer behavior, service usage, and churn risk are retained. Columns that represent the same underlying concept are renamed to a common schema prior to combining datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Feature Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The following feature concepts were identified as common across both datasets and relevant to predicting customer churn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Churn outcome**  \n",
    "  Indicates whether a customer discontinued service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer tenure / account duration**  \n",
    "  Captures how long a customer has maintained service, a known predictor of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Service plan characteristics**  \n",
    "  Includes indicators such as international plan enrollment or voicemail services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer service interactions**  \n",
    "  Measures how frequently a customer contacts customer support, which may signal dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage behavior**  \n",
    "  Represents how customers use telecommunications services, including call minutes and call frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Excluded Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Features that do not have a clear conceptual match across datasets or that represent dataset-specific artifacts are excluded from the merged dataset. Examples include:\n",
    "- Geographic identifiers such as state or area code\n",
    "- Dataset-specific billing breakdowns that are not directly comparable\n",
    "- Redundant charge variables derived directly from usage metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Excluding these features prioritizes consistency and interpretability over raw feature quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alignment Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Aligning features at the conceptual level allows the combined dataset to represent a broader and more diverse customer population while preserving semantic meaning. This approach supports the business goal of developing a churn detection system that generalizes across customer profiles rather than memorizing dataset-specific patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting aligned dataset will be used for all downstream modeling and evaluation.\n"

    "In many classification problems, overall accuracy is often treated as the primary measure of model performance. However, for customer churn prediction, accuracy can be highly misleading and potentially harmful from a business perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the positive class (churned customers) represents the customers we are most concerned about identifying. A model that predicts “no churn” for nearly every customer may achieve high accuracy simply because most customers do not churn, but such a model provides little to no business value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Precision, Recall, and Business Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "For a telecommunications company, the cost of different classification errors is asymmetric:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **False Negatives (Missed Churners):**  \n",
    "  These are customers who were predicted to stay but actually churned. This is the most costly error because it results in lost revenue and missed opportunities for retention intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **False Positives (Incorrectly Flagged Customers):**  \n",
    "  These are customers who were predicted to churn but would have stayed. While this results in unnecessary outreach or incentives, the cost is typically far lower and more controllable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the business objective is to *stop churn at all cost*, this project prioritizes **recall for the churn class** over overall accuracy. Precision remains important to control intervention costs, but recall is the primary metric used to evaluate model success.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metric Prioritization for This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary metric:** Recall (churn = 1)\n",
    "- **Secondary metric:** Precision (churn = 1)\n",
    "- **De-emphasized metric:** Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "All modeling decisions, including preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, are evaluated through this lens.\n"

    "## Baseline Model Business Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix highlights the tradeoffs made by the baseline model. By weighting the churn class more heavily, the model successfully captures a higher proportion of churned customers compared to an accuracy-optimized approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a business perspective, this behavior is desirable. False positives represent customers who receive retention outreach unnecessarily, which typically incurs a modest and controllable cost. False negatives, however, represent customers who churn without intervention, resulting in lost revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this baseline model may generate additional false positives, it establishes a recall-focused benchmark aligned with the business objective. The next step is to determine whether a more flexible model can further improve churn recall without disproportionately increasing false positives.\n"

    "# Model Iteration Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds of churn. While this provides interpretability, customer churn behavior is often driven by nonlinear interactions between usage patterns, service plans, and customer service experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better capture these interactions, a nonlinear model is introduced. The goal of this iteration is not complexity for its own sake, but improved recall for churned customers while maintaining an acceptable precision–recall tradeoff.\n"

    "Machine learning classifiers typically use a default decision threshold of 0.5 when converting predicted probabilities into class labels. However, this threshold is arbitrary and rarely optimal for real-world business problems.\n",

    "For churn prediction, adjusting the decision threshold allows the business to explicitly control the tradeoff between catching more churners (recall) and minimizing unnecessary interventions (precision). Lowering the threshold increases recall at the cost of additional false positives, which may be acceptable when the cost of missed churn is high.\n"
