    "Customer churn represents a significant financial risk for telecommunications companies, as acquiring new customers is substantially more expensive than retaining existing ones. This project addresses the business problem of identifying customers who are most likely to churn so that proactive retention strategies can be deployed before customers leave. By leveraging historical customer data related to tenure, billing behavior, service usage, and customer service interactions, the model helps surface early warning signs of churn. The primary stakeholder for this analysis is a telecommunications provider seeking to reduce churn-driven revenue loss through targeted intervention. The ultimate goal is not perfect accuracy, but maximizing the identification of high-risk customers so retention resources can be allocated effectively."

    "This project uses two publicly available telecommunications datasets that capture complementary aspects of customer behavior related to churn. The IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset provides customer-level information such as tenure, monthly charges, total charges, and churn outcomes, which reflect long-term relationship and billing patterns. The BigML Telecommunications dataset contributes detailed usage and service interaction data, including call activity and customer service calls, which capture short-term behavioral signals. Combining these datasets increases both the volume and diversity of churn-related information, allowing the model to learn from contractual, financial, and behavioral perspectives. While the datasets do not include personally identifiable information, they provide sufficient operational signals to support meaningful churn prediction and business decision-making"

The model pipeline includes preprocessing to handle scaling, encoding, and missing values, followed by SMOTE to address class imbalance in the churn target. Logistic Regression is used as the baseline because it is interpretable and provides a strong reference point for more complex models. Training the model at this stage establishes an initial performance benchmark for churn detection. This baseline helps evaluate whether later modeling choices meaningfully improve the ability to identify churners."

Gradient Boosting is capable of capturing complex, non-linear relationships in the data that simpler models may miss. As with the baseline model, preprocessing and SMOTE are included in the pipeline to ensure fair handling of feature scaling, encoding, missing values, and class imbalance. Training this model allows for a direct comparison against the baseline Logistic Regression approach. The goal of this step is to improve churn detection performance, particularly recall on churners, while maintaining reasonable precision."

Instead of relying on the default probability cutoff, the function converts predicted churn probabilities into binary predictions at various thresholds. This allows direct observation of how precision, recall, and overall performance change as the threshold is adjusted. Evaluating multiple thresholds is especially important in churn prediction, where recall on churners may be prioritized over overall accuracy. This function supports business-driven decision making by helping identify a threshold that best aligns with churn intervention goals."
