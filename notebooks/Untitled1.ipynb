    "Customer churn represents a major cost for telecommunications companies because retaining existing customers is significantly less expensive than acquiring new ones. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies customers who are most likely to churn so the business can intervene before the customer leaves. From a business standpoint, failing to identify a customer who is going to churn is more costly than incorrectly flagging a customer who would have stayed, which makes recall for churned customers the most important evaluation metric. As a result, the modeling approach in this project prioritizes capturing as many churners as possible, even when this comes at the expense of precision or overall accuracy."

    "The dataset used in this project combines two telecommunications churn datasets to create a larger and more informative sample of customer behavior. The features describe customer tenure, service plans, billing amounts, usage patterns, and customer service interactions, all of which are commonly associated with churn in the telecom industry. The target variable is churn, represented as a binary indicator showing whether a customer discontinued service. A key characteristic of the data is class imbalance, with non churners making up a larger portion of the dataset, which directly influences modeling decisions and evaluation metrics. This imbalance reinforces the need to focus on recall and churn detection rather than raw predictive accuracy."

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data preparation process begins by loading and inspecting two separate telecommunications churn datasets and aligning them into a consistent structure. Because the datasets originate from different sources, column names, data types, and target variable formats must be standardized before they can be combined. This includes converting churn indicators into a consistent binary format, resolving differences in categorical feature naming, and ensuring numeric fields are properly cast for modeling. Combining the datasets increases the total number of observations, which helps improve model stability and provides a more realistic representation of customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the datasets are merged, missing values are handled explicitly to ensure downstream models can train successfully. Numeric features are inspected for invalid or empty values and converted to proper numeric types where necessary, while categorical features are preserved for later encoding. No information is dropped prematurely, as retaining as much signal as possible is important for churn detection. At this stage, the focus is on preparing clean, model ready inputs rather than optimizing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, features are separated into numeric and categorical groups so that appropriate preprocessing steps can be applied to each. Numeric features are scaled to normalize their ranges, while categorical features are encoded to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models. These preprocessing steps are implemented using pipelines to ensure consistency, prevent data leakage, and maintain reproducibility. Structuring preprocessing this way allows the same transformations to be applied seamlessly during training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the prepared dataset is split into training and testing sets to allow for model evaluation. The split is performed after all structural cleaning but before any modeling so that the test data remains unseen during training. At this point, the data is fully prepared and ready to be passed into the baseline model, establishing a reference point for evaluating future improvements. This preparation process ensures that any changes in model performance can be attributed to modeling decisions rather than data inconsistencies."

A baseline logistic regression model is used first to establish a reference point and demonstrate how standard classification techniques struggle with churn detection on imbalanced data. From there, more advanced models are introduced that incorporate class weighting, resampling, and probability threshold adjustments to better align predictions with the business objective. All models are trained using pipelines to ensure consistent preprocessing and fair comparison.\n",

As model complexity increases, recall improves substantially, confirming that optimizing for churn detection requires deliberate tradeoffs rather than default settings.

    "The final model is selected based on its ability to identify churners with a high level of recall while maintaining reasonable precision. By applying class balancing techniques and adjusting the probability threshold, the model captures a significantly larger portion of customers who are likely to churn compared to earlier approaches. Although this results in lower overall accuracy, the tradeoff is intentional and aligned with the business goal of preventing customer loss. The evaluation metrics confirm that the model prioritizes churn detection rather than optimizing for non churn predictions.\n",
    "Threshold tuning plays a critical role in the final model’s performance by shifting the decision boundary to favor identifying potential churners. Lowering the threshold increases recall for churn, ensuring fewer at risk customers are missed. While this introduces more false positives, the business impact of incorrectly flagging a stable customer is far less severe than failing to identify a churner. This makes the final model suitable for proactive customer retention strategies."
